> Making a pizza with ES2015

This repository is to learn how to make a pizza with JavaScript. Read it on [this series of posts](). The project is not really available on `npm`.

I know that it may be a better way to do this, but this project is just to explore different parts of JavaScript in a fun way. That's been said, I will accept any `pull request` on this project, but feel free to open issues so we can discuss.

```bash
$ yarn add make-pizza
```


## Usage

const makePizza = require('make-pizza')

makePizza({ topping: ['BBQ Chicken'] }).then(res => res)
